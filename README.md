I am a Management Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, with a passion and curiosity to build my foundation of lifelong learning. I enjoy taking on challenging tasks and diving into new topics, and included in this repository, are projects I've worked on to build my technical skills. I am currently seeking Fall 2025 co-op / internship opportunities and am always happy to connect below!
